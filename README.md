# dVault

This project is intended to improve security and usability of secret data delivering to the edge and make a distributed chain of trust.

This theme is very crucial for the IIoT and DePIN sector. There are a lot of new devices set up every day with various purposes, from home to industrial. IIoT area is expected to have billions of devices in the near future. To have secure and automated infrastructure for secret data (such as certificates or API tokens) distribution and rotation is important for proper, healthy and secure work of any project or company. Here we come with the dVault solution for DePIN to improve remote access to drones, vehicles and robots and communication between them.

**Problem**

There is no secure and decentralized solution to distribute private data across devices. Centralized solutions can’t work in an honest and transparent way, and require infrastructure.

**Solution**

Decentralized no-infrastructure way to securely distribute private data utilizes the ICP smart contracts for integrity and IPFS to avoid infrastructure.

**Benefits**

- Activity history is publicity available and immutable.
- No centralized and managed infrastructure.
- User doesn’t need to trust third-party company, transparent integrity.
- Distributed responsibility.
